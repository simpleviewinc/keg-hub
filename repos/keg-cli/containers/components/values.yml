  # --- KEG-PROXY ENVs --- #

  # Most Keg-Proxy Envs are not needed, but can be overwritten to allow customization
  # When not set, the proxy will use keg-cli defaults as defined in the keg-cli default envs
  
  # KEG_PROXY_HOST: custom-host.local.kegdev.xyz
    # To override the host header used by the proxy to route traffic to this container
    # add KEG_PROXY_HOST env and set it's value to the what the host header should be
    # the default is <container-context>-<git-branch-name>.<KEG_PROXY_HOST>
  
  # KEG_DOCKER_NETWORK: custom-docker-network
    # To override the default docker network used by the proxy to route traffic to this container
    # There should be no reason to need to overwrite this, but you can if you want
    # add KEG_PROXY_HOST env and set it's value to the what network should be used
    # the default is 'keg-hub-net'

  # KEG_PROXY_PORT - 80
    # If not set, then port 80 will be used by default
    # Port the proxy will route traffic to within the container
    # This should be the port the application expects to receive traffic on
    # This port should not be ( You can still do these things, but it's better not to )
    #   * Exposed publicly on the container
    #   * Bound to the host machine
