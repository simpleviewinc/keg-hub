# Utilities
There a number of utility/helper methods that are exported from this library.
They are used internally by the Keg-Components, but are also useful in other contexts.

## isValidComponent
* Validates if the passed in parameter is a Component
* Returns `true` if `React.isValidElement` || `typeof` === `function`

## renderFromType
* Checks the passed in Elements type and formats it so react can render it
* Used to return the correct format of a Component from a React render function
