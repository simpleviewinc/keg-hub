# Welcome

Keg-Components is a set of cross-platform React and React-Native UI components for building applications.
The components can be used in both web and native (mobile/desktop) applications, without needing to worry about separate logic or compatibility.

Use these components as the base to build your application upon. This will allow a consistent and reliable way to write components once, then reuse them across multiple platforms

## Install
Keg-components is [hosted on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@keg-hub/keg-components) and can be installed using any package manager that uses the npm api

With **yarn**
```bash
yarn add @keg-hub/keg-components
```
With **npm**
```bash
npm install @keg-hub/keg-components
```

## Import / Use 

This library allows importing just what you need or the entire thing. Each component is exported individually to help keep bundle sizes down

**Individually**

```js
import { Button } from '@keg-hub/keg-components/button'
```

**Entire Library**

```js
import { Button } from '@keg-hub/keg-components'
```


## Theming

Keg-Components leverages [re-theme](https://github.com/simpleviewinc/re-theme) for dynamic theming across platforms and viewport sizes. See the [theming section](/?path=/docs/theme--page) for more information.

## Utilities

This library also exposes a number of react hooks and utility functions to speed up development. See the [utilities section](/?path=/docs/utilities--page) for more information.
