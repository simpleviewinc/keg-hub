# Theme

Keg-Components comes with a default theme for basic composition, but the theme can easily be overwritten by passing in overrides on initializaion.
This allows full customization to match any style guide or mockup.

## Initialization
Generally speaking, the theme is generated on intialization.
Components typically have a corisponding theme function that will construct the theme when called.

Initializing the theme, really means *Call all the theme functions for all the components*.
To do this, just import the theme export from `Keg-Components`, and call it.

### Example
```js

import { theme } from '@keg-hub/keg-components'
const myTheme = theme({ ...options })

```

### Options
In the above example, the theme initialize function is imported then called and it's passed a single options argument
This options argument is how the default them can be overridden or modified

## Usage
Once the theme has been initialized, it will be used automatically within the components.
This allows defining all theme changes in a single location, yet they are applied across all components
For example adding a `type` to the `colors` object of the theme defaults, will make it accessable to the button component automatically

### Custom Type

<Preview>
  <ReThemeProvider theme={ theme({ defaults: customTheme }) } >
    <View style={{ maxWidth: '80vw', margin: 'auto', marginTop: 30 }}>
      <Button type={'storybook'} >
        Custom Type: Storybook
      </Button>
    </View>
  </ReThemeProvider>
</Preview>

The above example sets the `type` prop to the value of `storybook` on the `Button` component.
Because `storybook` is not a default button type, typically the button would render without a background color.
To ensure the button renders with the correct color, the theme must be initialized with `storybook` type as an override
