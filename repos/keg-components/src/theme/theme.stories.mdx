# Theme

Keg-Components comes with a default theme for basic composition.
When consuming the Keg-Components, the theme can be easily overwritten by passing in overrides on initializaion.
This allows full customization to match any style guide or mockup.

## Initialization
Generally speaking, the theme is generated on intialization.
Components typically have a corisponding theme function that will construct the theme when called
Initializing the theme, really means *Call all the theme functions for all the components*
To initialize the theme, just import the theme export from `Keg-Components`, and call it.

### Example
```js

import { theme } from '@keg-hub/keg-components'
const myTheme = theme({ ...options })

```


### Basic Example

<Preview>
  <Story name="Basic">
    <Button type={'storybook'} >
      <View style={{ textAlign: 'center' }} >
        <Text style={{ color: '#FFF' }} >
          Custom Storybook Type
        </Text>
      </View>
    </Button>
  </Story>
</Preview>

The above example sets the `type` prop to the value of `storybook` on the `Button` component.
Because `storybook` is not a default button type, typically the button would render without a background color
To ensure the button renders with the correct color, the theme must be initialized with `storybook` type as an override
